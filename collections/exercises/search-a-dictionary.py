## Set a variable called choice to the flavor you want to search for.
choice = 'strawberry'
## Use an if statement to check if choice is in the flavors dictionary.
if choice in flavors:
    print('Yes')
## If it is, set another variable called cost to the value associated with choice.

## If it isnâ€™t, set cost to 0.
if choice in flavors:
    cost = 0.42
if choice not in flavors:
    cost = 0
print(cost)
## Print the cost.

### Search a Dictionary Part 2:

## Initialize two variables: highest_cost to 0 and fanciest to an empty string.
highest_cost = 0
fanciest = ''
## Loop through the flavors dictionary using a for loop.

    
## For each flavor, check if its price is higher than highest_cost.
## If it is, update fanciest to this flavor and highest_cost to its price.

## After the loop, print the most expensive flavor.
for flavor in flavors:
    if flavors[flavor] > highest_cost:
        fanciest = flavor
        highest_cost = flavors[flavor]
print(fanciest)
